## Description
Getting to know people can be awkward and messy, but icebreakers are a fun way to spark upbeat and genuine conversation without all the pressure accompanying social interaction to help others break the ice. ðŸ§Š

"We Broke the Ice" is a web application designed to centralize icebreaker ideas for easy access and provides intuitive step-by-step instructions. 
It also allows users to select a combination of tags which will send a request to Google Gemini for an icebreaker that meets all the selected criteria. Upon satisfaction, the user will accept the request and it will be added to the database.
